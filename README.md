Aioredis is now in redis-py 4.2.0rc1+

To install, just do `pip install redis>=4.2.0rc1`. The code is almost the exact same. You will just need to import like so:

```python
from redis import asyncio as aioredis
```

This way you don't have to change all your code, just the imports.

Now that aioredis is under Redis officially, I hope there will never be an unmaintained, asyncio Redis lib in the Python ecosystem again. I will be helping out maintenance at Redis-py for the foreseeable future just to get some of the asyncio stuff out of the way. There are also some bugs that didn't make it into the [PR](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/pull/1899) that I'll be slowly migrating over throughout the next few weeks -- so long as my exams don't kill me beforehand :)

Thank you all so much for your commitment to this repository! Thank you so much to @abrookins @seandstewart @bmerry for all the commits and maintenance. And thank you to everyone here who has been adopting the new code base and squashing bugs. It's been an honor!

Cheers,
Andrew
